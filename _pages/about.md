I am a PhD candidate majoring in cryptography at Department of Mathematical Sciences, Seoul National University (SNU), Republic of Korea. My advisor is Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/). 
I am interested in analyzing the security of various cryptographic primitives and homomorphic encryption.
Currently my research topics are on statistical analysis for cryptographic primitives and privacy-preserving machine learning.
