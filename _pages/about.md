I am a security engineer of confidential computing & storage security in SW development team at Samsung Electronics, Korea. My major research topics are fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC), and cryptanalysis.

I completed my PhD in 2024 at Seoul National University (SNU), where I was advised by Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/). In 2017, I graduated with Higest Honors from SNU where I majored in Mathematical Sciences and Economics.
